Abstract:   the idea is to describe design and implementation of a  .net cmd app
            done using  design patterns and why is this a good idea.


            The main idea of this program is to implement a simple command line
            app that allow to resize pictures by passing a path and a desired new
            size , also it will expose a command to simply double the size of a 
            picture also we should be able to ask for doing a copy or do resizing
            over the target picture.

            This app will be implemented using design pattern that ensures easy of
            extension so if latter we desire to extend this API it will be easy and
            well structured.
